# Pinatas

# Pinata Candy Problem Solver

This C++ program calculates the maximum number of candies that can be collected from a sequence of pinatas, each containing a specific number of candies. The approach involves calculating the product of candies in adjacent pinatas and recursively determining the maximum possible candies that can be collected.

## How It Works

The program works as follows:
1. **Input**: It prompts the user to enter the number of pinatas and then the number of candies in each pinata.
2. **Calculation**: For each pinata, it calculates the potential candies that can be collected considering the neighboring pinatas. It recursively explores all possible combinations to find the maximum number of candies.
3. **Output**: Finally, it displays the maximum number of candies that can be collected from the given sequence of pinatas.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
